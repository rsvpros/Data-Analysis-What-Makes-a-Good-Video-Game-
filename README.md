# Video Narration

[Go to the following link](https://www.loom.com/share/b98a06e92b04414f8a0991fd6158de7d) to watch the video narration of the file. 

# GET

To Get the data in this project, the file 'Video_Games_Sales_as_of_22_Dec_2016.csv' is imported into the rshanka4.ipynb file.

[Data originally retrieved from this site](https://www.kaggle.com/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings)

In the rshanka4 file it is cleaned and titles without ratings are dropped. A "Composite_rating" feature is added as well, averaging "User_rating" and "Critic_rating".

# Model

A linear regression model is set up in the "rshanka4.ipynb" file. I reference the "models.py" resource for linear regression, created by Dr. Stephyn Butcher
